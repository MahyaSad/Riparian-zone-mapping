Dual-Stream UNET3D for Satellite Image Segmentation

This repository contains a distributed training pipeline for a dual-stream satellite image segmentation model. The implementation leverages PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP), GPU-accelerated preprocessing using CuPy, and hyperparameter optimization via Optuna.

Note: The provided model (DualStreamUNET3D) is a placeholder. Replace it with your actual model architecture when deploying in production.
Overview

The code in this repository performs the following tasks:

model.py: Contains the model architecture implementation
dataset.py: Contains the dataset implementation with patch-based processing
train.py: Contains the training pipeline with distributed training support
config.py: Contains configuration settings
